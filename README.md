# react-javascript-calculadora-negative-numbers

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️]

--This is a Modified version from React JS Calculator project on FreeCodeCamp.com that handles the negative numbers based on a specific button instead of making a formula as a string then start to analyse it by str.match(RegEx-expression).

--Unfortunately it didn't pass test-case#13 because the program here is designed more dynamically than the one that supposed to be created on FreeCodeCamp to pass the test, o.w all results are successfully and correctly executed. 

--Note that this is an Immediate Execution Logic Calculator
