## Please Note that:

Unfortunately it didn't pass test-case#13 because the program here is designed more dynamically than the one that supposed to be created on FreeCodeCamp to pass the test, o.w all results are successfully and correctly executed. 

>Note that this is an Immediate Execution Logic Calculator
